About 30 Seconds To Launch:
This is a game I made participating in two "game jams" in September. The first requirement was to finish the game in a month. The second, was to have the game playable in a little more or less than 30 seconds. I set out to make a simple text based game, where you, as head of NASA's Houston station, were to oversee a scheduled launch. During the ignition process, with 30 seconds to go before take off, several systems begin to have issues. Normally this is something a pilot could easily solve with their own terminal, however they are preoccupied with the launch sequence. It is up to you to resolve these issues to allow launch to commence, but be careful, if too many issues mount, the rocket will explode. 
It is a very simple idea. For me, finishing meant: allowing the user to enter a response and have it read, have a system to stack issues with descriptions so as more issues arose solving them in order would reveal the appropriate error message, recognize that after 30 seconds had passed if the user had less than 6 errors stacked they would win, that if at any point the error total hit 6 the player would lose, and the ability to play again. 
Joining the jams late, and wanting to finish before the next topic started, meant I was limited to two weeks instead of a month. So, realizing the time limitation, I had to keep my scope short and concise. For me, I give this game the stamp of "finished". It's not pretty, but I am not an artist so that doesn't bother me. All I cared about was getting the systems set up. They function appropriately, and I completed it in my two week goal. I am happy with it, and it is done.
